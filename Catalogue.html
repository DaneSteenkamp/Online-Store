                                <p class="card-text">Xiaomi's Mi Smart Home Kit is the easiest way to get started with home automation. It's compatible with iOS and Android smartphones and compatible with other Xiaomi smart home products.
                                    Once plugged in, you need to use the Mi Home app to set it up. All of Xiaomi's products are very straightforward to set up, and the Mi Smart Home gateway is no different. Once you plug the gateway into the socket ensure your phone is connected to your Wi-Fi network and sign in to your Mi account in the Mi Home app. Then simply press down on the power button located at the top of the gateway for three seconds, and the app will automatically detect the new device. If the gateway emits a solid blue light, you've managed to pair it successfully with the Mi Home app.
